<h1 style="font-family: 'Baloo', cursive;">My musical development through time</h1>

<p>I've been playing the harmonica since 2011 and saxophone since 2015. Started in a band of some high school friends of mine playing rock and roll, and then added the saxophone, which opened me the door to the jazz world. </p>

<p>This page aims to show how I've been developing myself as a musician, by showing the different chords where I've been playing through time. If you click on each bullet you will see bellow the songs played in that moment on that chord.</p>
